- Added a line of text that displays how many "Words" were found. This includes a seperate counter if any "Real" words were found which does NOT include the "Fake" words
- Added a dictionary and a class that compares an input string vs the entire dictionary
- Adjusted the way the found "Words" are displayed to the user. Currently only "Real" words will be displayed. (This will be changed later with an option.)


5/6/2022
- Removed duplicate code
- Changed the rnd orderby shuffle into a fisher-yates shuffle

5/12/2022
- Removed Duplicate filtering option, it did nothing anyways
- Replaced Duplicate filtering option with "Fake Word Filtering" option. Saying yes to this will only display real dictionary tested words to the console. Saying no displays all outputs
- Program now checks for words smaller than the given words length
- Program now continues on forever, until there are no more possible words to generate (long as the words are longer than 3)

5/13/2022
- Results can now be printed to a text file
- New algorithim for finding max possible letter combinations implemented (please let me know if my horrible math is wrong)
- Added a fallback "timer" that quits the loop when all possible "words" have been found (Dependent on if my above math was right...)
- User can now choose to input a new word instead of restarting program each time (via a loop)



5/15/2022
- Started work on porting to a UI based application
- Created basic UI for application
- Ported Dictionary & Dictionary Check to application from previous application
- Application now checks the executable's location so it can write the results to a text file
